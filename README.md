# Portfolio

I am a Senior iOS Developer with over 5 years experience. I have worked on a number of different apps which have been released into the store throughout the entire lifecycle of app development. From creating new projects, the development of the app, the release of the app, as well as maintaing existing apps, to adding new features and reducing techincal debt. 

I have created an example app, showcasing my abilties in MVVM, Unit Testing and UI Testing which can be found [here](https://github.com/garethlloyd94/MovieFinder).

During my time at NN4M I have worked on a number of different apps, and have managed to gain a wide variety of experience in iOS development:

This has been my main project during my time at NN4M, starting as a graduate developer and progrssing on to leading the project for iOS and Android. During this time, I led the continous development team in writing new features, identifying any techincal debt as we went along and ensuring that relevant tickets were created in order to resolve these issues.

I was also the lead developer during the complete re-write of this project. This was a great oppurtunity to fix a lot of the underlying techincal debt that had been making developmet difficult for the team. The project was initially written in Objective-C and we had added new features in Swift. The rewrite allowed us to change the base code of the app into Swift, so it is now a 100% Swift project. The other reason for the rewrite was the backend system was upgrading from a post and scrape solution to becoming fully API driven. This required me to work with the backend team, and design a solution which supported both the existing system, and the new system without any interuptions to the user experience.

As part of my role I have always had junior developers to mentor, and I take great pride in watching them improve and grow as developers. I encourage their growth through a variety of different methods depending on the individual I am mentoring.

This was an opoprtunity for me to get my teeth into something new as it involved me joining up with an already existing external team, and contributing to a existing app, acting almost as a consultant. This was a great learning experience for both myself and the Emirates team, as we colloborated ideas on better ways of working. During my time working with Emirates I contributed to a new Baggage Tracker framework, which included making sure it was fully unit tested and fully UI Tested. After this framework, I have continued writing UI Tests for their already existing features, which is something I am working with my line manager to expand on within my current company.

I also had the oppurtuntity to work on a demo verision of the Emirates app, which was installed on all devices in the physical apple stores.

I had recently written the new Forms Framkework for the iOS team and initially joined this project to implement this. This led on to me taking over the lead of the project, and taking this through to the release of the app. My main achievement within this app was a biometrics security system which involved a pin entry backup ensuring users didn't have to remember their login details, but their credentials were secured.

Early in my career I was the lead developer of these two new apps, involving me creating the projects from scratch, refining designs, and solutions, and development right through until the release of the app into the store.

# Key Features

## Swipe-to-Like
This was a Tinder-like swipe-to-like module that was featured on the homescreen for Selfridges. This was driven by the "new in" products, which were then filtered by the users favourite brands and categories. If users like a product, they simply swipe right, and then the product is added to the wishlist. If not, they would swipe left, ensuring they wouldn't see it again. This was a really successful feature and has become one of the most interaced with modules on the homescreen.

## Forms Framework
The previous way of implementing forms was in Objective-C and was very difficult to work with, which was a massive pain point for developers. I wrote a Forms Framework which was a wrapper around Eureka (third party forms library), which is now used across a number of different projects within the company. This was designed to make forms as simple and flexible to develop as possible. The framework includes full validation, and is driven by a JSON file making it very simple to update the form.
