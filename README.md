# Portfolio

I am a Senior iOS Developer with over 5 years experience. I have worked throughout the entire lifecycle of app development on a number of different apps which have been released into the store. From creating new projects, the development of the app, the release of the app, as well as maintaing existing apps, adding new features and reducing techincal debt. 

During my time at NN4M i have worked on a number of different apps, and given me a wide variety of experience in developing apps:

## Selfridges
This has been my main project during my time at NN4M, starting as a graduate developer, to leading the project for iOS and Android. Durng this time, i led the continous development team in writing new features, identifying any techincal debt as we went along ensuring that relevant tickets were created in order to resolvetese

I was also the main developer during the complete re-write of this project. This was a great oppurtunity to fix a lot of the underlying techincal debt that had been making developmet difficult for the team. The project was initially Objective-C which we had added new features in Swift. The rewrite allowed us to change the base code of the app into Swift, so it is now a 100% Swift project. The other reason for the rewrite was the backend system was upgrading from a post and scrape solution to becoming fully api driven. This required myself to work with the backend team, and design a solution which supported both the existing system, and the new system without any interuptions to the user experience.

As part of this devlopment I have always had junior developers to mentor, and i take great pride in watching them improve and grow as developers. 

## Emirates

This was a different role than usual, and involved me joining up with an already existing team, and contributing to a existing app. This was a great learning experience for both myself and the Emirates team, as we colloborated ideas on better ways of . During my time working with Emirates I contributed to a new Baggage Tracker frmework, which included making sure it was fully unit tested and fully UI Tested. After this framework, I have continued on writing UI Tests for their already existing features. 

## Iceland

I initially joined this project, to implement Forms as the first app after I had written the new Forms framework. This led on to me taking over the lead of the project, and taking this through to the release of the app. The main achievement I developed within this app was a biometrics security system, which involved a pin entry backup, ensuring users didn't have to remember their login details, but their credentials were secured.

## Mint Velvet, Coast (No longer in store)
I was the lead developer of these two new apps, involving me creating the projects from scratch, refining designs, and solutions, and development right the way throught until the release of the app into the store.

# Key Features

## Swipe to Like
This was a tinder like, swift to like feature that was on the homescreen for Selfridges, which was driven by the new in products, filtered by the users favourite brands and categories. This involved the users swiping right, if the liked the product, which would add the product to the wishlist. They would swipe left if the didn't like the product ensuring they wouldn't see it again. This was a really successful feature and has become one of the most interaced with modules on the homescreen.

## Forms Framework
The previous way of implementing forms was in Objective-C and was very difficult to work with, which was a massive pain point for developers. I wrote a forms framework which was a wrapper around Eureka, which is now used across a number of different projects across the company. This was designed to make Forms as simple and flexible to develop as possible. The framework includes full validation, and is driven by a JSON file making it very simple to update the form.
